This is a draft of the FileManager class. It is unfinished. There might 
be bugs.


/////////////////////////// Running the code //////////////////////////

1) import file_manager.py. 
2) instantiate the class.
3) setup the directory structure with 
	 create_clinic_dir ('clinic_name', '.')
   Use '.' to create the clinic directory in the current directory.
4) now you can call any of the other FileManager functions

-see test programs for example usage



/////////////////////////// Files /////////////////////////////////////

-README

-file_manager.py - the FileManager class

-test1.py - run this to build a clinic directory called 'my_clinic'.
    A single patient's files are saved and then retrieved. A file with an 
    invalid file extension is saved and a resulting error message is 
    printed. 

-test2.py - builds 2 clinic directories 'my_clinic1' and 'my_clinic2' 
    each containing different files. All the files in 'my_clinic1' are
    transferred to 'my_clinic2' and the user is asked whether or not
    files should be overwritten.

-tmp.pkl, tmp.img, tmp2.img, tmp.csv, tmp.xml, tmp.docx 
    These are used by test1.py and test2.py



///////////////////////// Planned Changes /////////////////////////////

-transfer_clinic_files () might undergo drastic changes since it's 
 is unclear to me exactly under what conditions directories will get 
 merged.



///////////////////  Notes on the Current Design //////////////////////

-create_clinic_dir sets up the following directory struture:
    /<root_directory>/<clinic_name>/clinic_config.pkl
                                   /patients/
                                             images/
                                             CSV/
                                             pickles/
                                             xmls/
                                             fingerprints/

-files are saved with the following filename format:

  <familyName>_<givenName>_<UUID>_<time_stamp>_<counter>.<fileExtension>

    -counter is a number (0 to some large number) used to prevent filename 
     conflicts
    -if the file is the profile image, the counter field is 'p'

-create_clinic_dir (clinic_name, root_dir) sets up the clinic directory
 structure rooted at root_dir
    -This function must be called before any of the others
    -The path to the clinic directory is stored in a 'private' variable
     which all other instance methods use to access the directory

-save_patient_files (patient_object, *files, **special_files)
    -Currently I'm not preventing duplicate files from being saved.
     All files with the same extension have the same name with a 
     numerical suffix to prevent conflicts.
    -Only '.pkl', '.img', '.fingerprint', '.csv', and '.xml' files can be 
     saved. '.fingerprint' is a placeholder.
    
-transfer_patient_files is probably not working as intended. The current 
    file naming scheme is to save all files with the same file exetension 
    under the same name with a counter. The problem occurs when an image
    file is saved for a particular patient in one clinic directory, and 
    then image files for that same patient are transferred from another 
    clinic directory. The first image file will be overwritten by another,
    perhaps unrelated, image file.
